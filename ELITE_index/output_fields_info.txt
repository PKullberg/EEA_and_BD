## Explanation of Automated-ELITE-process output fields


#### STANDS_ELITE


stand_id = ID of the stand

PA_name = Name of the protected area where the stand is located

PA_id = ID of the protected area where the stand is located (SAKTI has own fields for different types of protected areas)

PA_type = Type of protected area (All that have their own name fields in SAKTI). NATURA/ VSA (Government owned protected areas, Valtion suojelualueet) / YSA (Private protected areas) / VMS (Goverment owned areas for other protective uses, Valtion muut suojelutarkoituksiin varatut alueet)

inventoryclass = Type of habitat. See SAKTI documentation.

forvegetation_zone = Forest vegetation zone. See SAKTI  documentation

area_ha = area of stand in hectares

inventory_year = year when forest inventory has been done on stand

habitat = habitat type as in explained in ELITE_calculator function. Lehdot / kankaat / karukot

PA_area_ha = Total area of Protected area where stand is located, hectares

PA_forest_ha = Forested area of Protected area where stand is located, hectares

PA_forest_pct = Forested area (%) percentage of Protected area total area

large_trunks = number of large trunks on stand. As default large trunk is defined as larger than 40cm diameter from breast height. 

broad_leaved = amount of broad-leaved trees on stand (m3/ha)

dead_wood = amount of deadwood on stand (m3/ha)

decayclass_1_m3 = amount of deadwood from decay class 1 (m3) (1-hardest)
decayclass_2_m3 = amount of deadwood from decay class 2 (m3)
decayclass_3_m3 = amount of deadwood from decay class 3 (m3) (3-softest)

elite = ELITE-index of stand

geometry = (ETRS89 / ETRS-TM35FIN, EPSG:3067)

or

centroid_lat = latitude of stand centroid (ETRS89 / ETRS-TM35FIN, EPSG:3067)

centroid_lon = longitude of stand centroid (ETRS89 / ETRS-TM35FIN, EPSG:3067)

### PA_ELITE

same as above, plus:

elite_mean = area weighed mean value of all calculated stand ELITE-indices in Protected area

elite_QualityXX_ha = area of quality forest indicated by Elite index (for example elite_Quality30_ha with treshold value 0.3) - summed area of all stands that have ELITE-index larger than set quality treshold value (XX)

elite_QualityXX_pct = amount of quality forest indicated by Elite index in protected area (%). Quality stand area percentage of PA total forested area.

elite_var = variance of all stand Elite_indices in protected area.

PA_elite_forest_coverage = Percentage (%) of forested area of PA total area.

lehto_pct = percentage (%) of lehto-habitats (see field "habitat") of PA total area

kangas_pct  =  percentage (%) of kangas-habitats (see field "habitat") of PA total area

karukko_pct  =  percentage (%) of karukko-habitats (see field "habitat") of PA total area

median_deadwood_m3 = median of stand specific values in PA

median_broadleaved_m3 = median of stand specific values in PA

median_largetrunks_per_ha = median of stand specific values in PA


geometry = combined geometry of PA stands where ELITE-indices were calculated (ETRS89 / ETRS-TM35FIN, EPSG:3067)

or

centroid_lat = latitude of geometry centroid (ETRS89 / ETRS-TM35FIN, EPSG:3067)

centroid_lon = longitude of geometry centroid (ETRS89 / ETRS-TM35FIN, EPSG:3067)
